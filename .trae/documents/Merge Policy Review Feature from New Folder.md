I have identified the relevant code for the "Policy Review" (保单检视) feature from the `保单检视` folder.

**Plan:**

1.  **Create New Component**:
    *   Create `src/components/PolicyReviewModal.tsx` using the code from the `保单检视` folder. This component handles the policy review configuration, preview, and editing.

2.  **Update Existing Component**:
    *   Update `src/components/CustomerManagement.tsx` to match the version in the `保单检视` folder. This will:
        *   Integrate the "Policy Review" button and modal logic.
        *   Update the page layout to the new version (including Search, Tabs, Lifecycle, Purchase Preferences, etc.) provided in your new code.

3.  **Cleanup**:
    *   The `保单检视` folder can be deleted by you after this operation (as you mentioned). I will only modify the files in `src/components/`.

**Note**: This will overwrite the current "Customer Management" page UI with the version from your `保单检视` folder to ensure all new functionalities (like the Policy Review Modal integration) work exactly as designed in your new code.
